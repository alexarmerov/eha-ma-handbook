# Encryption

- _How do we share data in git repositories that needs to be secure?_

Sometimes we need to store and share secure information, such as API keys to
paid online service accounts.  One of our methods of choice for this is to
keep these files stored in git/GitHub repositories, but to encrypt them.  We
do this using PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption, implemented by the program
[`git-crypt`](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt).  It takes a bit to set up
but once activated makes sharing secure and seamless.

The PGP encryption scheme involves making a _public_ key that you share and
a _private_ key that you use to decrypt data encrypted with your public key.
We like  and use [Keybase](https://keybase.io/), a service that helps you publish and
verify a public key for this purpose.

Instructions for setting this up are below.  They assume you are using MacOS
for local work, but are mostly right for other cases, too.

### Set up Keybase

Sign up for [Keybase](https://keybase.io/), and follow the instructions for 
installing it on your laptop.

For installing on linux, first identify the distribution by entering
the following command into a terminal and noting down the Distributor ID.

    lsb_release -a

In the case of the servers this will be 'Ubuntu' which is based on Debian. 
Next identify the architecture via.

    arch

For the EHA servers this will be 'x86_64'. Follow the instructions to install Keybase on
Linux, available [here](https://keybase.io/docs/the_app/install_linux), making sure
to use the section relevant to the architecutre and distribution information identified
above.

### Install `gpg` and `git-crypt`

`gpg` is the program that implements encryption, and `git-crypt` sets up git
repos for encrypted sharing.  These are aleady installed on EHA servers.  To install
them on a mac, use `homebrew`.  You should also install `pinentry`.

### Create your Keybase keys 

If you are just starting to use keybase, you can generate new keys for use on
your computer using [this guide](https://github.com/pstadler/keybase-gpg-github).
The guide also helps set up using your key to sign GitHub commits, which you
should do for added security.

Do create a password associated with your keys when asked.  You can store
this in a service such as LastPass if desired.

At this point you can go to your Keybase account and verify your keys via as
many other services, devices, or online identities as you want.  We suggest
at least three.

### Import your keys to your local keychain

If you have a Keybase account set and keys already generated, you can now import
your Keybase keys to use.  Instruction are found [here](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2017/09/06/using-keybase-gpg-macos/). Do set
your keys to maximum trust level.


### Also import your keys to the EHA server

You will probably want the ability to decrypt files when working remotely,
so place them on the EHA server.  You can do this by copying over your whole
`gpg` keys directory to the server, like so:

    scp -rp ~/.gnupg url.of.server:

Note that the main EHA analysis servers share user file systems so you only
have to do this on one of them.

You may have to edit the file `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf` on the server.  If
its first line is `pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac`, change it to
`pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry`. Note that it may not exist at all, which
is fine - it means the program is just using default behavior.

### Use git-crypt

The [`git-crypt` README](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) outlines the basics
of using `git-crypt` to add encrypted files to a git repository.  If you are
using an encrypted repository someone else set up, they should have added your
public key to the repo, and all you need to do after pulling/cloning is run

    git-crypt unlock
    
in the repository folder.  After that encryption and decryption for pushing and
pulling should happen automatically.

One key area missing is how to import the public keys of your team members to
your local keychain. Visit their Keybase profiles (e.g., <https://keybase.io/noamross>) and click on the key - it will show several ways to import the keys.

Another common source of errors is that the text entry for `gpg` isn't set properly. You can fix this by setting the `GPG_TTY` environment variable like so:

    export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
    
Add this to your `.profile`, `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` or other settigns file.

### Extra: Use a symmetric key for automated processes

If you are using continuous integration on a repository with encrypted files,
you'll need to provide a way for the CI system to unlock them.  An easy, but
not _most_ secure way is to provide a _symmetric key_.  You can generate
this by running this in your project directory.

    git-crypt export-key git_crypt_key.key

`git_crypt_key.key` can now be used to decrypt the repository, and you can provide
it to the CI system as an environment variable.  However, since it is binary data,
you'll need to convert it to base64 first.  So run something like:

    cat git_crypt_key.key | base64 | pbcopy

to convert this file to base64 data, then paste it in your CI system's environment
variable field as something like `GIT_CRYPT_KEY64`.

To use the key later, you'll need (1) `git-crypt` and `gpg` installed in the CI
system image, and (2) to run these commands after the CI clones your repository:

    echo $GIT_ENCRYPT_KEY64 > git_crypt_key.key64 && base64 -d git_crypt_key.key64 > git_crypt_key.key && git-crypt unlock git_crypt_key.key
