# R and Reproducible Analysis {#r}

*Can everything be re-done easily if I change one data point in the inputs?*

At EHA **R** is our primary, though not exclusive, tool for analysis and
modeling work. R is not just a piece of software for statistics and data
manipulation but a computer language, meaning that analsyes are *scripted* and
thus can be automated, run again, built upon and extended.

## Install

-   [R itself](https://cran.r-project.org/)
-   [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), the leading R development environment.

## Learn

Learning R is beyond the scope of this document, and you likely already have
some experience in it, but some good starting points are:

-   [The Software Carpentry
    Lessons](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)
-   [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/), a set of interactive lessons run right
    in R.
-   [The JHU Courera
    Series](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)

-   [R for Data Science by Hadley Wickam](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a
    beginner/intermediate text that we highly recommend for getting up to speed
    with the particular workflows we recommend and the most recent packages that
    support them.

-   [Advanced R (Wickham)](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) is very good for
    understanding how the language works.
-   [Efficient R by Colin Gillespie and Robin
    Lovelace](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/) is helpful for
    imporving workflows and speeding up code.
-   [R Packages (Wickham)](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) is good for package
    development.
-   [Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) from RStudio
    are a useful references for a number of things.
