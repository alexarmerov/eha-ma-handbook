# Statistical Methods

Statistical methods are a far larger subject than can be covered in this handbook.
Our team uses a wide variety of methods that change by project and with new updates to

-  We like Generalized Linear Models. Many of us approach these from a Bayesian perspective,
   and build and fit these models using [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/).  A great introduction to
   this type of modeling is found in [Statistical Rethinking](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/),
   by Richard McElreath which we have a couple of copies of. Richard also has accompanying lectures for
   this book online as [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdM9_N6XUUFrhghGJ4K25bFc).
-  For nonlinear models, we like Generalized Additive Models, for which we use the **mgcv** R package. Noam has
[a bunch of materials](https://github.com/noamross/2017-11-14-noamross-gams-nyhackr) on this, including slides and exercises from a workshop he co-teaches, and the seminal text is [Generalizd Additive Models in R](https://www.amazon.com/Generalized-Additive-Models-Introduction-Statistical/dp/1498728332/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?_encoding=UTF8&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0), by Simon Wood.  (Example- Host-Pathogen Phylogeny Project: [Paper](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22975), [GitHub](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/HP3)
-  When a multivariate analysis is primarily about prediction, and less about variable inference, machine-learning methods such as **boosted regression trees** are useful.  We make use of these through the **dismo** or **xgboost** packages.
